    "\n",
    "    The primary aim of this activity is to transition from using Numpy for network implementation to utilizing PyTorch, a powerful deep learning framework. You will be replicating the work you did for the ASL dataset in Activity 1b, but this time, you'll implement a your multi layer FC model using PyTorch.\n",

    "    Review Previous Work: Begin by reviewing your Numpy-based Fully Connected Network for the ASL dataset from Activity 1b. Note the architecture, hyperparameters, and performance metrics for comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Introduce PyTorch: If you're new to PyTorch, take some time to familiarize yourself with its basic operations and syntax. You can consult the official documentation or follow online tutorials.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Prepare the ASL Dataset: As before, download and preprocess the Kaggle ASL dataset. \n",

    "    Implement the Network: Design your network architecture tailored for the ASL dataset. Pay special attention to PyTorch modules like nn.Linear() and nn.ReLU().\n",

    "    Train the Model: Implement the training loop, making use of PyTorch's autograd to handle backpropagation. Monitor metrics like loss and accuracy as the model trains.\n",

    "    Analyze and Document: In Markdown cells, discuss the architecture choices, any differences in performance between the Numpy and PyTorch implementations, and insights gained from using a deep learning framework like PyTorch."

    "The primary difference between using NumPy and PyTorch lies in the ease and power that PyTorch provides for deep learning model development. Here is a conclusion regarding the difference between using NumPy and PyTorch:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ease of Development**: PyTorch significantly simplifies the development of deep learning models compared to NumPy. With PyTorch, you can define and train neural networks in a more intuitive and concise manner with less code. PyTorch offers a more user-friendly, object-oriented interface for building and training models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Automatic Differentiation**: One of the most powerful features of PyTorch is its automatic gradient computation. PyTorch automatically tracks operations on tensors, making backpropagation of gradients during training much easier. This simplifies the implementation of deep learning algorithms like stochastic gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **GPU Optimization**: PyTorch provides stronger integration with GPUs, enabling significant acceleration of model training on compatible hardware. While NumPy can also leverage GPUs, PyTorch streamlines the process and offers better tensor management on GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Active Community and Related Libraries**: PyTorch has an active community and a wide range of related libraries and tools that ease deep learning development and experimentation. This includes libraries like TorchVision for computer vision and TorchText for natural language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Portability and Deployment**: PyTorch offers tools for converting models into formats that can be easily deployed in production, simplifying the transition from research-trained models to practical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, while NumPy is a fundamental library for scientific computing in Python, PyTorch is purpose-built for deep learning model development and provides a more comprehensive and streamlined experience for data scientists and researchers working in this field. Automatic differentiation, GPU acceleration, and development conveniences make PyTorch a popular choice for deep learning projects."
